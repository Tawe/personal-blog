## 1. Overall Color Philosophy

**What we’re aiming for**

- Light, airy, editorial
    
- Confident but not loud
    
- Human and approachable
    
- Executive, not startup-y
    

**What we’re avoiding**

- Pure black / pure white
    
- Neon or high-saturation blues
    
- Dark-mode heaviness
    
- “Tech product” contrast ratios that feel aggressive
    

Think: _Atlantic coast morning_, not _midnight ops center_.

## 2. Core Palette (Derived from Your Headshot)

### 🧱 Base Neutrals (Foundation)

These do most of the work.

`Background – Primary #F6F8FA   (soft off-white, not sterile)  Background – Secondary #EDF1F5   (section breaks, subtle contrast)  Border / Divider #D6DEE6   (quiet structure, not boxes)`

Why:

- Mimics natural light + overcast sky
    
- Keeps pages open and breathable
    
- Makes long-form writing comfortable
    

---

### ✍️ Text Colors (Readability First)

`Primary Text #1F2933   (deep slate, warmer than black)  Secondary Text #4B5D6B   (subheads, metadata, excerpts)  Muted Text #7A8A99   (dates, tags, helper copy)`

Rules:

- **Never use pure black**
    
- Body text should feel calm, not punchy
    
- Contrast should support reading, not dominate

## 3. Primary Accent (From Denim / Sky)

This comes straight from your shirt + background tones.

`Primary Accent (Links, primary buttons) #3A6EA5   (desaturated steel blue)  Hover / Active #2F5F90`

Use for:

- Links
    
- Primary CTA (sparingly)
    
- Active nav state
    
- Section emphasis
    

Avoid:

- Using this everywhere
    
- Multiple blues competing with it
    

If you only use _one_ color besides neutrals, make it this one.

---

## 4. Secondary Accent (Warm Human Counterbalance)

This prevents the site from feeling cold or overly technical.

`Secondary Accent (Optional) #B89B7A   (soft sand / driftwood)  Very Light Variant #E6D9CB`

Use _rarely_ for:

- Quote marks
    
- Small editorial flourishes
    
- Highlighting “human” moments (About page, pull quotes)
    

Rule:

> If someone _notices_ this color, you’re using it too much.

---

## 5. Success / Emphasis (Very Subtle)

Only if you need it.

`Positive / Emphasis #5F8F7A   (muted sage)`

Use cases:

- Small indicators
    
- Optional success states
    
- Never as a primary CTA
    

---

## 6. What to Remove from the Current Site

Based on your screenshots, I’d explicitly **kill**:

- Neon or electric blues
    
- High-contrast card borders
    
- Dark gradients
    
- Glow effects
    
- Color-coded category blocks
    

Those all fight the new direction.

## 7. Example Usage Map

**Homepage**

- Background: `#F6F8FA`
    
- Headline: `#1F2933`
    
- Subhead: `#4B5D6B`
    
- Primary button: `#3A6EA5`
    
- Secondary button: outline only, text `#3A6EA5`
    

**Writing Pages**

- White/off-white background
    
- No cards, or extremely soft ones
    
- Links in primary accent only
    
- Tags in muted text
    

**Projects**

- Light neutral backgrounds
    
- One image per project
    
- Minimal badges, low contrast
    

---

## 8. Dark Mode? (Optional Recommendation)

If you _do_ keep dark mode:

- Make light mode default
    
- Dark mode should be **soft charcoal**, not black
    

`Dark Background #0F1720  Dark Surface #16202A  Dark Text #E5EBF0  Dark Accent #6FA3D9`

But honestly?  
This redesign works _best_ as **light-first**.

## 9. One Guiding Rule (Important)

> If a color exists, it must carry meaning — not decoration.

This palette supports:

- Writing
    
- Thinking
    
- Experience
    
- Calm authority
    

Not hype. Not urgency.
