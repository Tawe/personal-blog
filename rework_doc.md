# **Website Rework Canvas – JohnMunn.tech**

  

## **1. Goals & Intent**

  

**Primary Goal**

Rework the site to feel **lighter, airier, and more inviting** while preserving **professional credibility and executive presence**.

  

**Secondary Goals**

- Reduce cognitive load and visual heaviness
    
- Present a unified narrative of _leadership + technical thinking_
    
- De-emphasize “services for sale” in favor of _thought leadership and capability signaling_
    
- Make the site feel more human, calm, and confident rather than dense or sales-driven
    

  

**Non-Goals**

- Aggressive lead capture or funnel design
    
- Overly playful, whimsical, or novelty UI
    
- Personal brand dilution into hobbyist or niche content
    

---

## **2. Audience**

  

**Primary Audience**

- Engineering leaders (Manager → VP)
    
- Founders / executives evaluating senior technical leadership
    
- Hiring managers and recruiters
    

  

**Secondary Audience**

- Technical peers
    
- Writers / thinkers interested in leadership & systems
    

  

**Audience Perception Target**

  

> “This person is thoughtful, calm, experienced, and credible. They’ve clearly done the work.”

## **3. Structural Changes (Information Architecture)**

  

### **3.1 Global Navigation (Proposed)**

  

**Current**

Vision · Strategic Narratives · Services · Workbench · Contact

  

**Proposed**

- Home
    
- Writing
    
- Projects
    
- About
    
- Contact
    

  

_(Navigation should feel minimal and breathable — no more than 5 primary items.)_

---

### **3.2 Remove: Services**

  

**Rationale**

- Services positioning adds sales pressure and heaviness
    
- Mentoring / consulting can live implicitly through _About_ and _Contact_
    
- The site should lead with thinking and experience, not offerings
    

  

**Result**

- No explicit “Services” page
    
- Any collaboration language moved to Contact or About (soft, optional)
    

---

### **3.3 Strategic Narratives → Writing**

  

**Current Issues**

- Too many sub-categories fragment the work
    
- Artumin and D&D content dilutes professional signal
    
- Leadership and Technical Architecture are already intertwined
    

  

**Proposed Changes**

- Rename **Strategic Narratives** → **Writing**
    
- Combine:
    
    - Leadership & Strategy
        
    - Technical Architecture
        
        → **Single unified writing stream**
        
    

  

**Remove Entirely**

- World of Artumin
    
- D&D and TTRPGs
    

  

_(These can live elsewhere or remain unpublished.)_

  

**Outcome**

- One cohesive body of work
    
- Readers experience your thinking holistically
    
- Less explanation required, more confidence implied
    

---

### **3.4 Workbench → Projects**

  

**Rename**

- Workbench → **Projects**
    

  

**Intent Shift**

- From “experiments and tinkering” → “credible, curious, applied work”
    

  

**Content Guidelines**

Each project should communicate:

- What problem it explores
    
- Why it exists
    
- What it says about how you think
    

  

Avoid:

- Apologetic language (“weekend project”, “just a prototype”)
    
- Overly playful framing

## **4. Visual Design Direction**

  

### **4.1 Overall Feel**

  

**Target Mood**

- Calm
    
- Airy
    
- Confident
    
- Human
    

  

**Move Away From**

### **4.2 Color Palette (Derived from New Headshot)**

  

**Primary Inspiration**

**Suggested Palette Roles**

- Backgrounds: warm off-white, very light grey, or soft blue-grey

- Accents: desaturated blue drawn from denim / sky tones
    
- Secondary accents: subtle warm neutrals (sand, stone)
    

  

**Rules**

- Fewer colors, used more intentionally
    
- Accents only where meaning or action is implied
    

---

### **4.3 Typography**

  

**Direction**

- Highly readable sans-serif for body text
    

  

**Principles**

## **5. Homepage Rework**

  

### **5.1 Hero Section**

  

**Goals**

**Tone Example (Not Copy)**

  

> “I help teams and leaders navigate complex systems — technical, human, and organizational.”

---

### **5.2 Content Emphasis**

- Writing featured first
    
- Projects secondary
    
- Contact as a gentle invitation, not a CTA push
    

---

## **6. About Page (New or Expanded)**

Avoid:

- Resume dumping

---

## **7. Writing Page Requirements**

  

**Structure**

- Optional filters by theme (lightweight)
    

  

**Presentation**

- More editorial, less card-heavy
    
- Emphasis on titles and excerpts
    

---

## **8. Projects Page Requirements**

  

**Each Project Should Include**

- One-sentence purpose
    
- What it explores or demonstrates
    
- Links only if relevant
    

  

**Visual Style**

- Consistent imagery
    
- Minimal badges
    
- Calm presentation
    

---

## **9. Contact Page**

No scheduling tools required.

---

## **10. Success Criteria**

  

The redesign is successful if:

- The site feels noticeably lighter and calmer
    
- Content feels unified rather than segmented
    
- A hiring manager can quickly understand your value
    
- Nothing feels defensive, apologetic, or overly performative
    

---

## **11. Open Questions (For Next Iteration)**

- Serif vs sans for headlines?
    
- Light mode only vs subtle dark mode toggle?
    
- Editorial index vs chronological writing feed?
