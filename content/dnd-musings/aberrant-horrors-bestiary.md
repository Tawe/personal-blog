# Aberrant Horrors

*A Collection of Unique Aberrations*

The Far Realm touches our world in strange and terrible ways, spawning creatures that defy natural law and mortal comprehension. This collection presents twelve unique aberrations, each designed to challenge players not just mechanically, but psychologically.

## Design Philosophy

These creatures are built around the principle that aberrations should feel *wrong*. They break the normal rules of biology, physics, and sometimes reality itself. Each monster includes:

- **Unique mechanics** that create memorable encounters
- **Psychological elements** that unsettle players
- **Scaling suggestions** for different party levels
- **Plot hooks** for campaign integration

## The Creatures

### 1. Void Whisper
*Small aberration, chaotic evil*

**Armor Class** 15 (Natural Armor)  
**Hit Points** 45 (10d6 + 10)  
**Speed** 0 ft., fly 40 ft. (hover)

**STR** 6 (-2) **DEX** 18 (+4) **CON** 12 (+1) **INT** 16 (+3) **WIS** 14 (+2) **CHA** 20 (+5)

**Saving Throws** Wis +5, Cha +8  
**Skills** Deception +8, Insight +5, Stealth +7  
**Damage Resistances** Cold, Necrotic  
**Damage Immunities** Psychic  
**Condition Immunities** Charmed, Frightened  
**Senses** Blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 12  
**Languages** Deep Speech, telepathy 120 ft.  
**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP) **Proficiency Bonus** +3

#### Special Abilities

**Whispers of Madness.** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the void whisper must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature hears maddening whispers and takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage. On a critical failure (natural 1), the creature also gains one level of madness (see DMG p. 259).

**Incorporeal Movement.** The void whisper can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

#### Actions

**Psychic Drain.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 18 (4d6 + 4) psychic damage, and the target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target's maximum hit points are reduced by the damage taken. The void whisper regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

**Maddening Visions (Recharge 5-6).** The void whisper projects horrifying visions in a 20-foot radius. All creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they take 21 (6d6) psychic damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage and aren't stunned.

#### Tactics

Void whispers prefer to remain hidden, using their incorporeal movement to stay within walls or ceilings. They target spellcasters first, using their psychic drain to weaken magical defenses. When cornered, they unleash maddening visions to create chaos.

#### Lore

Void whispers are fragments of consciousness torn from the Far Realm and given semi-corporeal form. They hunger for the ordered thoughts of mortal minds, seeking to drag sanity back into the chaotic void from whence they came.

#### Plot Hooks

- A series of unexplained madness cases in town coincides with strange whispers heard at night
- The party discovers a cult trying to summon void whispers to drive their enemies insane
- Ancient ruins contain trapped void whispers that activate when certain areas are explored

### 2. Flesh Weaver
*Medium aberration, neutral evil*

**Armor Class** 16 (Natural Armor)  
**Hit Points** 112 (15d8 + 45)  
**Speed** 30 ft., climb 30 ft.

**STR** 18 (+4) **DEX** 14 (+2) **CON** 16 (+3) **INT** 12 (+1) **WIS** 15 (+2) **CHA** 8 (-1)

**Saving Throws** Con +7, Wis +6  
**Skills** Medicine +6, Stealth +6  
**Damage Resistances** Bludgeoning, Piercing  
**Condition Immunities** Disease  
**Senses** Darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 12  
**Languages** Deep Speech  
**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP) **Proficiency Bonus** +3

#### Special Abilities

**Surgical Precision.** The flesh weaver's attacks against creatures with flesh deal maximum damage on a critical hit instead of rolling damage dice twice.

**Regeneration.** The flesh weaver regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and has dealt damage to a living creature since its last turn.

#### Actions

**Multiattack.** The flesh weaver makes three attacks: two with its surgical claws and one with its bone needle.

**Surgical Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its maximum hit points reduced by 5 (2d4). This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.

**Bone Needle.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Flesh Sculpting (1/Day).** The flesh weaver touches a willing or unconscious creature and begins reshaping its flesh. Over the course of 10 minutes, the flesh weaver can:
- Heal all of the target's hit points and remove one disease or condition
- Permanently alter the target's appearance
- Grant the target one of the following benefits for 24 hours: +2 to one ability score, resistance to one damage type, or one additional attack per turn

#### Tactics

Flesh weavers prefer to incapacitate targets with their bone needles before closing to melee range. They focus on reducing enemy hit point maximums to weaken the party over time. When possible, they retreat to heal and return later.

#### Lore

Once mortal surgeons who delved too deeply into forbidden anatomical knowledge, flesh weavers have been transformed by their obsession with perfecting the mortal form. They see all living creatures as flawed works of art in need of correction.

#### Plot Hooks

- A renowned healer offers miraculous cures but is actually a flesh weaver building a collection of "perfect" specimens
- The party discovers a hidden laboratory where a flesh weaver has been experimenting on kidnapped villagers
- A flesh weaver offers to heal a party member's permanent injury in exchange for allowing it to "study" the party

## Using These Creatures

### Scaling for Different Levels

**Lower Levels (1-4):** Reduce hit points by 25% and remove one special ability. Focus on the psychological horror rather than mechanical complexity.

**Higher Levels (11+):** Increase hit points by 50% and add legendary actions. Consider giving them lair actions in their home territories.

### Campaign Integration

These aberrations work best when introduced gradually:

1. **Foreshadowing:** Strange dreams, unexplained phenomena, or NPC behavior changes
2. **Investigation:** Clues that point to something unnatural
3. **Encounter:** The actual confrontation with the aberration
4. **Aftermath:** Dealing with the psychological and physical consequences

### Psychological Horror Elements

- **Uncanny Valley:** Describe familiar things that are slightly wrong
- **Body Horror:** Focus on unnatural transformations and violations of physical integrity
- **Cosmic Horror:** Emphasize the creatures' alien nature and incomprehensible motivations
- **Paranoia:** Make players question what's real and what's aberrant influence

## Conclusion

Aberrations should be more than just stat blocksâ€”they should be experiences that linger in players' minds long after the session ends. Use these creatures not just as combat encounters, but as tools for creating atmosphere and advancing themes of cosmic horror and the fragility of sanity.

Remember: the goal isn't to traumatize your players, but to create memorable moments of tension and unease that enhance the overall narrative.
