_"Stone sings. You just have to know how to listen."  -  Old miner’s saying_

### Overview

A fusion of dwarven ingenuity and natural adaptation, the **Dwarven Tunneling Mole** is a bioengineered or magically-altered subterranean beast bred for precision excavation. Native to ancient dwarven holds long since collapsed or sealed, these massive creatures once served as living tools - burrowing through bedrock with uncanny precision. Now, many roam free beneath the earth, their programming blurred by time, their instincts mutated into dangerous habits.

---

### Physical Description

Roughly the size of an elephant, the Dwarven Tunneling Mole bears armored plates of metallic chitin, etched with ancient dwarven runes once used to program or control it. Its forelimbs end in rotary claw-drills - natural augers evolved (or crafted) to displace stone, not just dirt. Their snouts vibrate at high frequencies, capable of detecting minute air pockets, fault lines, or distant echoes in the rock.

The faint glimmer of geodes or gemstones may be seen embedded in their hides - a result of decades spent nosing through mineral veins.

---

### Habitat & Range

Dwarven Tunneling Moles thrive in deep underground networks: abandoned mines, ancient dwarven cities, and natural cave systems. Their burrows are smooth, reinforced by residual magic and oil-slick excretions that keep walls stable.

These creatures are most common in regions with dense mineral compositions, particularly where deep-earth resonances (geothermal vents, tectonic friction) stir ancestral programming.

---

### Behavior

Originally docile and obedient, centuries of neglect or exposure to wild magic have made many moles territorial or erratic. Some operate in near-mechanical cycles, endlessly carving spirals or labyrinths with no discernible purpose. Others form loose colonies, communicating through seismic pulses and pheromonal trails.

They are not inherently aggressive - but they **will defend a chosen excavation zone with lethal force**, seeing intruders as threats to structural integrity or dig-site “objectives.”

Despite their intimidating size, these moles are intelligent. They can navigate complex tunnel systems with perfect memory and react to cave-ins or threats with engineered precision.

---

### Diet

Dwarven Tunneling Moles consume certain minerals and fungi for sustenance. They are especially drawn to **crystal formations**, **metal-rich stones**, and **deep lichen**. When minerals are scarce, they may grind down and extract trace elements from old dwarven masonry or enchanted stone - often destroying relics in the process.

---

### Reproduction & Life Cycle

Rarely observed, the moles reproduce by **laying a single, geode-like egg** in warm, mineral-rich chambers. These eggs take decades to hatch, absorbing energy from surrounding stone and ambient magic. Newly hatched moles are the size of a large dog and take over a century to reach full size.

Some believe a now-lost dwarven song or ritual was once required to trigger hatching.

---

### Role in Dwarven Society (Historical)

Once revered as the pinnacle of dwarven bioengineering, Tunneling Moles were used to dig ventilation shafts, forge escape tunnels, or lay the groundwork for entire cities.

They were guided using harmonic tools - pipes, tuning forks, and drums - that resonated with specific frequencies. Only dwarves of certain clans knew the full suite of control tones.

When the Holds fell - due to war, collapse, or abandonment - the moles were forgotten… or sealed away.

---

### Interactions with Other Creatures

- **Drow and Duergar** have attempted to harness or clone the species with limited success.
- **Purple Worms** view the moles as competition and will attack on sight.
- **Myconids** sometimes cohabitate with dormant moles, especially if they've grown fungal crusts in hibernation.
- Adventurers occasionally stumble on “fossilized” moles - stone-coated and seemingly inert - only to awaken them with noise or light.

### Usages for Parts of the Mole

Certain parts of the Dwarven Tunneling Mole are highly prized by alchemists, smiths, and arcanists:

- **Chitinous Plates**: Can be smelted down to produce _Runesteel_, a lightweight metal that retains enchantments exceptionally well.
- **Vibratory Snout**: Used in crafting _Seismic Lenses_, goggles that allow the wearer to "see" tremors or nearby movement through walls.
- **Claw-Drills**: Reforged into _Earthcutters_, weapons or tools capable of burrowing through stone or armor alike.
- **Oil-Slick Secretions**: Bottled for use in _Collapse Prevention Salves_, stabilizing stonework or magically reinforcing tunnels.
- **Pheromonal Glands**: Utilized in _Beast Lures_ or as components in potions of control animal (burrowing type only).
- **Geode Eggshells**: Can be ground into powder and used in high-end enchanting rituals, especially earth-aligned magic.

### Adventure Hooks

- A dwarven city has begun collapsing - investigations reveal a mole is still digging below, following ancient orders.
- A noble wants to recover a legendary control flute said to tame a sleeping mole deep within the underdark.
- A mine has struck a sealed egg chamber, awakening defensive instincts in nearby adult moles.

> ___
> ***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The wolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
>
> ***Pack Tactics.*** The wolf has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the wolf's allies is within 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
>
> ***TRAITS.*** Echo Mapping. The mole emits low-frequency vibrations as it moves. It can sense structures, voids, and creatures through solid stone using tremorsense. It automatically knows the location of all creatures and objects in contact with the ground within 90 feet.<br>
> <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siege Monster. The mole deals double damage to objects and structures.<br>
> <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stone-Fused Biology. When the mole takes force or thunder damage, it emits a resonant burst. All creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 minute.<br>
> <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control Rune Node. If a creature uses an action to make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check while adjacent to the mole and in possession of a control tuning fork or dwarven harmonic flute, it can attempt to issue a command (as command spell). Success allows temporary control of the mole’s actions for 1 minute.
> ### Actions
> ***ACTIONS.*** Multiattack. The mole makes two Drill Claw attacks.<br>
> <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drill Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hit: 21 (3d8 + 7) slashing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.<br>
> <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burrowing Charge (Recharge 5–6). The mole burrows in a straight line up to 60 feet, emerging with a tremor. Each creature in a 10-foot-wide line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone on a failed save, or half damage on a success. The terrain in the path becomes difficult terrain and lightly obscured with dust and rubble.<br>
> <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vibrational Roar (Recharge 6). The mole emits a thunderous pulse in a 30-foot radius. All creatures other than constructs must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn.
