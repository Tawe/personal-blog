If you keep saying “the business” like it’s something separate from engineering, you’re reinforcing the very silos you’re trying to fix.

> _The business needs this by Q4.  
> IT needs to support the business better.  
> Let’s get stakeholder sign-off before engineering starts._

Harmless on the surface, right?

But every time we say “the business” like it’s not _us_, we’re drawing a line. And that line quietly tells engineers, _you’re here to serve, not shape._

## The Language That Builds Silos

We’ve created a script that keeps engineering outside the strategy room.

Let’s break it down:

### **The Handoff Frame**

> _We’re gathering requirements.  
> We’ll translate needs into specs.  
> We need sign-off to begin._

This frames product like a factory line, business thinks, engineering executes.

But that’s not how great work happens.

### The Vendor Mindset

> _IT will deliver for the business.  
> Engineering resources are being allocated._

This turns engineering into a service desk. Waiting for instructions instead of shaping the solution.

### The Translation Myth

> _We need to bridge the gap.  
> Let’s translate this into business language._

If you need a translator, it’s already broken.

Great teams speak a shared language. Outcomes, constraints, customers.

## What This Language Actually Does

It rewires behavior.

**Engineers start thinking:**

- Just tell me what to build.
- Strategy’s not my job.

**Business leaders start thinking:**

- I define the what, they figure out the how.

And that’s how you end up with turf wars, mismatched priorities, and roadmap ping-pong.

## When Language Shifts, So Does Culture

I saw this firsthand with a team that constantly butted heads. Product pushed hard for features; engineering pushed back. Everyone was capable, the problem was a lack of alignment on what they were actually solving.

Then a VP reframed the conversation:

> _Let’s stop asking what the business wants. Let’s talk about what our customers need and what tradeoffs we’re willing to make._

That one shift changed everything. The tension gave way to real problem-solving, engineers leaned in, and the roadmap got sharper. Fast.

## What Happens If You Don’t Fix This?

You get:

- Strategy disconnected from delivery
- Teams optimizing for different outcomes
- Progress that feels like swimming through glue

But orgs that _do_ fix it?

- Move faster
- Make smarter bets
- Build cultures where everyone owns the outcome

## Try These Swaps

Small language shifts can lead to big mindset shifts:

|Instead of...|Say...|
|---|---|
|"The business wants this feature"|"Our customers need this capability"|
|"IT supports business goals"|"We're working toward our shared goals"|
|"Requirements gathering"|"Understanding the problem"|
|"Business sign-off"|"Team alignment"|
|"Engineering resources"|"Our engineers" or "Our capacity"|

## The Bottom Line

If you work in tech and still say “the business” like it’s something separate from you?

It’s time to stop.  
**Engineering is the business.  
Always has been.**

It’s time we talked like it.
