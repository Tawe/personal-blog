The loudest player at the table isn't always the one you need to listen to. Sometimes, the key to keeping a campaign or a team, together is pausing long enough to understand _why_ someone is frustrated, not just _what_ they're saying.

It's easy for us as DMs and leaders to reward the people who are truly bought-in, the ones who roleplay the most or lead the team-building exercises. But sometimes those other players or team members aren't bought in _because_ we haven't focused on them.

I had a player in one of my games, let's call him Mark. He started out enthusiastic and fully engaged. But as the months passed, he began missing sessions. When he did show up, he seemed distracted, often on his phone. Eventually, the other players began complaining, even asking me to remove him from the group.

I didn't want to give up on him. I crafted elaborate plot points, NPCs, and lore centered around his character. For a while, it worked. He showed up on time, engaged more. But within a couple of months, he was back to old habits. I couldn't hook him, and I didn't understand why.

Some assumed he just didn't like D&D, but I knew he played in other games. I was at my wit's end when the obvious solution finally hit me: _just ask him._

So I took him out for lunch. I asked him point blank what was going on. He told me he loved the spotlight and appreciated everything I was doing, but this campaign just wasn't his style of D&D.

I was crushed. All that effort, the custom arcs, the attention, I felt like I had failed him. Was I a bad DM? Had I misunderstood everything?

He went on to explain: he was a beer-and-pretzels player. He liked kicking down doors, slaying monsters, and looting dungeons. The rest of the group was into slow-burn narrative and deep RP, and he didn't want to ruin their fun. The only reason he stayed was because he liked the people.

His revelation was a breath of fresh air. I asked him what he wanted. He said he'd love to stay if there could be a bit more combat, though he didn't want to throw off the group. So I went home and messaged each group member individually, asking for their thoughts on pacing and the balance of the three pillars of play.

To my surprise, several agreed. While they didn't want _as much_ combat as Mark, they _did_ want more action.

By simply asking, I discovered a compromise was possible. From then on, I made sure every session had at least one meaningful action sequence. It wasn't just for Mark. It rebalanced the whole group. He reengaged. The phone stayed in his pocket. And slowly, the table began to feel like a team again.

What surprised me most was how little it took to change the dynamic: a conversation, a few honest questions, and the humility to adjust. That's a lesson I've carried with me into leadership ever since. Real listening isn't passive. It's not just staying quiet, it's making someone feel safe enough to share. That means asking open-ended questions, watching for what's _not_ being said, and resisting the urge to jump in with solutions too soon.

In fact, it changed how I respond to disengagement on my team. A while ago, a senior developer started showing up late, taking long lunches, and leaving early. My gut reaction was frustration, just like I'd felt with Mark. But I caught myself. Instead of assuming disengagement, I invited them to talk. That's when I learned they were dealing with a sick child at home. They hadn't said anything because they didn't want to burden the team.

Everything changed after that conversation. We worked with HR to restructure their schedule and give them the flexibility they needed. My frustration melted away, replaced with empathy and a renewed desire to support them as a person first. And I know I wouldn't have handled it that way if I hadn't learned the importance of listening from my time behind the DM screen. They were trying to balance work while caring for a sick child at home. They hadn't brought it up earlier, and I hadn't thought to ask.

That conversation reengaged him. We found a path forward that brought him back into the fold, and I don't think that would've happened if I hadn't learned to pause and listen back at the game table.

As a DM, I learned that behind every silence or derailment, there's usually a story waiting to be heard. As a leader, I've learned to pause and ask, _"Can you tell me more?"_ before jumping into feedback or solutions. A team member seems disengaged, and the temptation is to assume laziness or poor attitude. But more often, it's something deeper: misalignment, lack of clarity, or feeling unheard.

**Seek first to understand.** When a team member is underperforming, complaining, or even just acting out of character, resist the urge to fix or judge right away. Ask questions. Listen longer than feels comfortable. You may uncover a motivation or struggle that reframes everything.

DMing taught me that people don't always speak in direct language, they express through choices, disengagement, or deflection. Sometimes it's a glance, a slumped posture, or the way someone hesitates before answering. The same is true at work.

You can't lead people well if you don't understand them. Listening isn't optional, it's the job. If you aren't taking the time to truly hear the people you lead, you're not leading at all. You might be managing projects or chasing metrics, but real leadership begins with listening. Whether you're guiding adventurers through a dungeon or developers through a deadline, empathy always rolls with advantage.
