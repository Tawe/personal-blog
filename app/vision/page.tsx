              I believe in <strong className="text-blue-400">systems thinking at every level</strong>: from code
              architecture to team structure to organizational design. Great technology organizations mirror great
              software systems - they're modular, resilient, and designed for change. Technical debt isn't just a code
              problem; it's an organizational challenge that requires strategic thinking and clear communication to
              address effectively.

              systems and teams that can evolve. The architectures I champion are designed for adaptability, with clear
              boundaries that allow teams to innovate independently while maintaining system coherence. Like a
              well-designed D&D campaign, the best technical systems provide structure that enables creativity rather
