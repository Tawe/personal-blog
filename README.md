# 🎯 John Munn's Personal Blog

> **Technical Leader | Engineering Strategist | Team Builder | Dungeon Master**

Welcome to the repository powering [johnmunn.tech](https://www.johnmunn.tech/) – where technical leadership meets strategic storytelling, and where I share insights on building scalable solutions and high-performing teams.

## 🚀 About This Blog

This isn't just another tech blog. It's a place where I blend analytical precision with creative problem-solving, drawing from my experience as both a technical leader and a Dungeon Master. Here, you'll find thoughts on:

- **Technical Leadership** - Building and scaling engineering teams
- **Strategic Thinking** - Architecting solutions for complex challenges
- **Innovation** - Exploring emerging technologies and methodologies
- **Team Building** - Creating cultures of excellence and collaboration
- **Problem Solving** - Applying creative approaches to technical challenges

## ✨ What Makes This Different

Just as a good D&D campaign requires strategic planning, compelling storytelling, and adaptive leadership, successful engineering organizations need the same blend of skills. I bring this unique perspective to every post, combining:

- Real-world engineering experience
- Strategic business thinking
- Creative problem-solving approaches
- Team dynamics and leadership insights

## 🌐 Domain redirect (www → apex)

The site uses **johnmunn.tech** (no www) as the canonical URL. To avoid redirect loops and CORS errors:

1. In **Vercel Dashboard** → your project → **Settings** → **Domains**
2. Set **johnmunn.tech** (apex) as the primary domain — it must **not** redirect to www
3. Add **www.johnmunn.tech** and set it to **Redirect to johnmunn.tech**
4. Do **not** add any redirect from johnmunn.tech to www

That way only www → apex redirects happen at the edge; apex never redirects to www.
